# Hi!

Francisco here, nice to meet you! It's been a long road over these years. Here you can find some repositories I already have as public. Usually my work is located in private repositories, but I expect in the future to build some stuff as public domain. For now, my work has all my time and dedication. Btw, if you want to check or improve anything here, go ahead, a huge part of my life at this moment is about coding.

I have some websites, but I have to dedicate more time to keep them updated. Who knows... maybe some automated tooling I could generate would help improve the content in terms of generating it. Anyway, here are the links if you want to see a little about this:

Any comment, any feedback is welcome. See u!
